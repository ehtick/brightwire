# About
Bright Data is a data table, data processing and data analysis library for .NET.

Data tables are immutable and can be stored either in memory or on disk and can be used as the input to Bright Wire's machine learning graph.

Data tables can contain tensors (including vectors and matrices), binary data, strings, sparse vectors and numbers.

Tensor based linear algebra uses hardware acceleration when possible.
